# Todo app

Uppon some serious deliberation I have decided to update my todo app to use:
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
[React](https://reactjs.org/).
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
[React-spring](https://react-spring.io/).

I would love to add a wider variety of features to this app that includes:

- [ ] Add tasks.
- [ ] Re-order tasks.
- [ ] Search for tasks.
- [ ] Remove tasks.
- [ ] Storage of tasks.

I hope the end result will be worth while.

## Usage

Feel free to use the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```

You may use this code in anyway you see fit.

## Contributing

Any aditions or changes to the code should be made through the [Github repo](https://github.com/ricahardHaggioGwati/Todo-App).
I would love your feedback on the code.

Happy coding!
