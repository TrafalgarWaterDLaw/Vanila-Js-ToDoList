# Todo app

Uppon some serious deliberation I have decided to update my todo app to use:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/).

I would love to add a wider variety of features to this app that includes:

- [*] Add tasks.
- [*] Remove tasks.
- [ ] Storage of tasks.
- [ ] Dark theme. ðŸ˜Ž
- [ ] Light theme. ðŸ˜Š
- [*] Mark tasks as done.
- [*] Mark tasks as important.

I hope the end result will be worth while.
